### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ my name is Sara and I just turned my professional career around studying web development.


ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in technologies, they have always interested me and one of the decisive steps to change the sector has been, above all, the fact of being able to build things that help solve everyday problems.

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m already certified as a Full Stack Web Developer by Codespace Academy. 

The project I did for the final course is here in the fyh-findYourHealth repository. It's made with ReactJS, SASS, MongoDB, NodeJS and Express. Using JWT for the authentication.ðŸŒ±
